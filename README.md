## Hi, I'm Dr David J Turner!

I am an observational astrophysicist who specialises in X-ray emissions from galaxy clusters - particularly what they can tell us about the mass, pressure, and astrophysical processes of these huge objects, and how we can use that information to improve cosmological measurements. 

My other focus is on the development of open-source software packages for the acquisition, processing, management, and analysis of large samples of archival X-ray data - I am the founder and project lead of the XGA-DAXA ecosystem (I'll come up with a better name at some point), which develops 'X-ray: Generate and Analyse' (XGA) and 'Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy' (DAXA). Much of time and energy is dedicated to trying to improve access to archival data, and to developing tools that mean we can focus on new analyses over the basic production and analysis of data products. 

I am an assistant research scientist at University of Maryland - Baltimore County (UMBC) and a staff scientist at the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC).

If you're interested in any of this, I would love to give a talk at your institution, please reach out - david.j.turner@umbc.edu
